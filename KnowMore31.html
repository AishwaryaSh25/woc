    <div class="pales">Justin is a father, husband, teacher, and public schools advocate. He puts his heart into his classroom,
         home, and state. If you've kept up with policy related to NC public schools, odds are you've read his investigative
          reporting and commentary on his blog Notes From the Chalkboard and other news outlets.

        After experiencing a recent stroke, Justin learned he needs heart surgery to prevent future stroke events. His original 
        surgery was scheduled for December 2023 but has now been postponed to 2024 due to a second stroke.
        
        This postponement means his family will be starting over in meeting their annual health insurance deductible.Please join Red4Ed 
        friends in supporting the heart Justin shares with so many by contributing to this fundraiser toward his health care.</div>
