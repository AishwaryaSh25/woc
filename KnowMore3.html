    <div class="pales">Dear friends and compassionate others,
        It is with a heavy heart that I share with you the devastating news of the passing of my beloved sister Karuna Ambadi (wife of Kranthi). Karuna fought a valiant battle against acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Our Mission: We have launched this GoFundMe campaign with below critical objectives:
        Covering Medical Expenses: The burden of medical bills weighs heavily on Karuna’s family. We want to ease their financial strain during this difficult time. Every contribution, no matter how small, will make a difference.
        Any funds remaining after paying off medical expenses will be used to establish a fund for Karuna’s child’s future.
