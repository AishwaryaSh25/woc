    <div class="pales">I found this little baby boy chained on a fence at a riding camp known to mistreat their elephants in Laos. An elephant 
        camp that hits their elephants with bullhooks and allows tourist to ride on their backs. We worked out a deal with his owner to buy his 
        freedom. Since he is only 8 months old, he is an excellent candidate to be set free and placed into the wild. Once we raise the funds to 
        secure his freedom, we will introduce him to a 3,000-acre property that the Laos government is letting us use for a wild elephant
        reintroduction project. If we don't rescue him now, he will spend the rest of his days chained to a post to view for people's pleasure.
         Or possibly be sold to a Chinese zoo.This rescue is a joint effort between US-based non-profits Planting Peace and Laos Elephant
         Initiative. 100% of funds raised will go toward securing Touffu's freedom.</div>
