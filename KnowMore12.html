      A lot of villages and parts of Nepal still live in high poverty and
      Damauliâ€™s public school is no different. These kids dream of escaping
      their village, of college degrees and better lives for their
      families.Books are treasuresI suggested that I would try to raise some
      funds for her students here in the US and send it back so that the
      students can have proper materials for school and enough to buy nice
      sweaters for winters. With all this, our hopes is to support the future of
      our country and try to give these kids a chance at a good life while
      they're studying . A small step for you, a giant leap for the children. By
      giving these students the tools they need, we plant seeds of hope, not
      just for their education, but for the future of Nepal itself. All of the
      money raised will be sent directly to my mother Suna, who will work with
      the school to buy necessary school supplies and clothes for the students.
      Join me in making a difference.
