    <div class="pales">Hello everyone,

        I am the sister of Physics Girl, Dianna Cowern. She has been battling the horrible debilitating sickness of Long Covid,
         a disease very new with no known cure. She has been out of work for 6 months now, bedridden requiring round-the-clock 
         care.It's difficult to explain how painful - physically, mentally, and emotionally - these crashes are. Her body reacts
          to everything with severe inflammation and allergic-type reactions to normal, everyday items like food and clothing, 
          temperature changes, fragrances, basically anything that isnâ€™t her. 
          Her sweet husband has been her caretaker, and this money will help them through this unthinkable and difficult time. 
         Keep her in your thoughts and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for any help.</div>
