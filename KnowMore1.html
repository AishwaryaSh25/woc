      Hi! I created this campaign to help a very hardworking and smart
      Palestinian friend who is in their second year at a state university in
      Massachusetts and is having a hard time securing payments for tuition.
      They came straight from Palestine and have no means of support in the
      states which is why they are unable to take out a loan. They have a
      remaining of $8,000 to cover the rest of fall tuition, and $16,000 to
      cover spring tuition.So far, they have been able to maintain a 3.80 gpa,
      excelling in all of their classes as a computer science major. Besides
      academics, they have been working full time to support themselves and
      their family who are living in Palestine. Help in any amount is really
      appreciated.
