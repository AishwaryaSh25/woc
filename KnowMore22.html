    <div class="pales">I designed a wildlife clinic with my staff. I have found a contractor willing to build this unique place.
         There are two plots of land I am currently looking at.

        It’s going to be expensive. The average cost to start a veterinary clinic is $1,000,000. We believe we can build a wildlife 
        clinic and get it started for $750,000. This will include the building the clinic, the equipment we will need to purchase,
         building new enclosures. and a new rescue vehicle. I am making the goal on GoFundMe $500,000 as I believe some funds will come 
         from other areas.I never imagined the rescue getting as big as it has - but the need has been great, the support has been there 
         and the desire to help is there.

         I’m daring to dream, guys and I’m dreaming big…
